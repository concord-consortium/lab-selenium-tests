These laws correlate different properties and provide\ninsights to the states of a system and processes it undergoes.\nMathematical models can therefore be derived based on the laws, allowing\nscientists and engineers to explain what has happened or predict what\nwill happen.\n\nIf a mathematical model is too complicated to solve, a computer will be\nneeded. Thus, we have a **computational model** that approximates the\nsolution using some numerical algorithms. Computational models are now\nincreasingly important parts of computer-aided design (CAD) packages,\nwhich are in the tool box of almost every engineer whose job involves\nresearch and development (R&amp;D). Computational models are often\ncalled **numerical simulations**. So we will use the two terms\ninterchangably.\n\nToday\\'s students need to have a fundamental understanding of what\ncomputational models are and how they can be used to accelerate R&amp;D\nprocesses.\n\nThe following is a simple model of solar heating of a house. Use the\ncontrols to play with it and explore how such a model contributes to\ndeveloping an understanding of the physical variables and processes\ninvolved in designing solar houses.\n\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Reload page\"\nonclick=\"window.location.reload()\" />   \n  \n **Reload the entire page to reset the model and the buttons.**\n\n",
